        <h2>About elephants</h2>
        <img src="35_14.jpg">

        <p>Of the two species, African elephants are divided into two subspecies (savannah and forest), while the Asian
            elephant is divided into four subspecies (Sri Lankan, Indian, Sumatran and Borneo). Asian elephants have
            been very important to Asian culture for thousands of years – they have been domesticated and are used for
            religious festivals, transportation and to move heavy objects.
        </p>

        <h3>Diet</h3>

        <p>Staples: Grasses, leaves, bamboo, bark, roots. Elephants are also known to eat crops like banana and
            sugarcane which are grown by farmers. Adult elephants eat 300-400 lbs of food per day.</p>

        <h3>Population</h3>

        <p>At the turn of the 20th century, there were a few million African elephants and about 100,000 Asian
            elephants. Today, there are an estimated 450,000 - 700,000 African elephants and between 35,000 - 40,000
            wild Asian elephants.</p>

        <h3>Behavior</h3>

        <p>Elephants form deep family bonds and live in tight matriarchal family groups of related females called a
            herd. The herd is led by the oldest and often largest female in the herd, called a matriarch. Herds consist
            of 8-100 individuals depending on terrain and family size. When a calf is born, it is raised and protected
            by the whole matriarchal herd. Males leave the family unit between the ages of 12-15 and may lead solitary
            lives or live temporarily with other males.

            Elephants are extremely intelligent animals and have memories that span many years. It is this memory that
            serves matriarchs well during dry seasons when they need to guide their herds, sometimes for tens of miles,
            to watering holes that they remember from the past. They also display signs of grief, joy, anger and play.

            Recent discoveries have shown that elephants can communicate over long distances by producing a sub-sonic
            rumble that can travel over the ground faster than sound through air. Other elephants receive the messages
            through the sensitive skin on their feet and trunks. It is believed that this is how potential mates and
            social groups communicate.</p>

    <h2>FAQ</h2>
    <dl>
        <dt>
        <p> How much does an elephant weigh?</p>
        </dt>
        <dd>
            <p> On average, an Asian elephant weighs between 10 000 pounds (4535 kg) and 12 000 pounds (5443 kg).
                African elephants are slightly larger and heavier, and an African bull can weight up to 13 225
                pounds (6000kg).</p>
        </dd>

        <dt>
        <p>Are elephants ruminants?</p>
        </dt>
        <dd>
            <p> Ruminants are mammals that first partly digest food in one stomach, then regurgitate it and chew it
                further before re-ingesting it. Elephants do not follow this course. Their stomach is used mainly
                for storage of food, and more digestion takes place in the intestine. In fact, their faeces still
                contains much of the vegetation that they ate, which means that they need to eat vast quantities of
                food in order to absorb the necessary amount of nutrients. This is also why their dung is a popular
                choice for faeces-eating animals – much of the nutrition and substance remains fairly intact.</p>
        </dd>

        <dt>
        <p>Do elephants have teeth?</p>
        </dt>
        <dd>
            <p>Yes. Their tusks (tushes in Asian females) are the incisors. A total of 4 molars (two upper and two
                lower) are situated directly behind these. These molars move back to make space for more molars 6
                times in their lives, making a total of 24 molars by the time they have matured completely. These
                flat, strong teeth allow them to grind vegetation down into a thick pulp rather than having sharp
                teeth that tear at meat.</p>
        </dd>
        <dt>
        <p>How fast can elephants run?</p>
        </dt>
        <dd>
            <p>Elephants can only run short distances at a time because of their considerable size and weight. They
                reach a top running speed of approximately 40km (25 miles) an hour. This is a speed that rivals even
                the fastest humans.</p>
